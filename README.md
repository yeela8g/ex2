## Description
the purpose of the program in this milestone is to impement KNN machine learning algorithm.Given a classified dataset, the KNN algorithm predict the label of test a sample by its similarity to features of other samples. it calculates similarity by distance metrics, choose the k closest samples to the test sapmle with the lowest distances, and returns the most common label among them.

the input of the algorithm is:
- k (number of closest neighbors to predict by them)
- file path (with the classified dataset)
- distance metric (auclidean/manhatten/chebishev/canberra/minkovski formula)
- features of the test sample
and the output is the predicted label of the sample.

## Optimization
- created dedicated class ('KnnManager') for controlling the algorithm flow.
> this optimized our code by maintaining the main class simple and clean.

## edge cases treatment
- in case of equality between labels the knn will select the first Label that appears in the dataset.
- in case of sample in the dataset with invalid values, the program will print a message and will keep predicting without it.
- in case of invalid input of one of the program's three arguments (k/path/distance metric), or missing arguments, a runtime error will be thorwed and the program will end.
- for calculating minkovski distance we chose constant p = 2;
